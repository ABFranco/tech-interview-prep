# Technical Interview Prep Guide (SWE)

A comprehensive study guide I slowly and continually contributed to en route towards landing a SWE job at **Google**.


Firstly, I encourage you to read my LeetCode discussion post discussing my journey and relevant LeetCode advice: https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/908588/i-hate-the-system-i-understand-the-system-thank-you-leetcode

<br>

This repo is meant to be **forked!!** Take it and make it yours :)

<br>

# Repo Structure
**`topics/`**

This holds all related topics you'll ever encounter on a general LeetCode question or typical interview.

I've learned **studying and mastering the concepts** is a far greater help than just doing the "most liked" or "top rated" questions on leetcode. Harden your fundamentals!

<br>

Each topic has its own markdown (.md) file with all of my favorite associated problems inside them along with my attempted code snippet in Python. After each snippet, I added a personal takeaway section to help me remember quickly what was necessary to understand to solve the problem. Please feel free to delete/overwrite them in your forked repo.

The most important file in this folder is **cheatsheet.md**. This holds summary bullets of points to remember about a given topic. Again, these were specific to me, and I encourage you to overwrite these points so they make sense to you.

**`me/`** 

This folder has empty markdown files like projects.md, about-me.md. Please put your resume here! I have my own private repo of this to hold my resume and other experience info. These are helpful to reference.

**`readings/`**

Contains single file links.md of my favorite sites I used to study outside of my coding problem prep.

# Recommended Prep Plan

Here, I detail a recommended prep plan for those of you just starting.

## 1. Choose your Programming Language

Pick your favorite, and mainline that. 99% of the time you have a choice over the most popular languages for a generic SWE role.

## 2. Create a LeetCode Account
https://leetcode.com/

I recommended buying premium if you know you have interviews immediately coming up, definitely worth it.

## 3. Read my LeetCode Post
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/908588/i-hate-the-system-i-understand-the-system-thank-you-leetcode

## 4. Read through the Algorithms section of:
https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/algorithms/algorithms-introduction

This is one of my favorites from links.md, and quickly offers a refresher course on each concept. You can do his concept problems, or use my own.

Bookmark this site! It's fantastic for all aspects of the coding interview.

## 5. Study `topics/`
Read through one concept at a time, please try clicking the LeetCode link on top of each problem snippet. Try it yourself and come back to mine if you like.

## 6. Create your own LeetCode/Study Schedule
Master the concepts, then dive into LeetCode's top-rated/liked problems. It usually takes 4 weeks to get comfortable with easy's, then another 4 weeks to get comfortable with medium's.

If you are comfortable with > 90% medium problems, you are ready.

## 7. Fork this repo & get working!

## 8. Do the LeetCode Competitions!
Single best practice you can do to check your readiness. LeetCode offers 1.5 hr long coding contests on Saturday nights. They deliver 4 problems (1 easy, 2 medium, 1 hard). These were the most helpful to me, and I really saw myself grow.

If you can get 3/4 problems consistently, you are ready.

## 9. Go through Links.md fully
Go through the rest of my favorite links.

# Lastly
Be patient with yourself. If you fail contests, or interviews, don't let that get to you. You're on a personal mission to improve, go at your own pace, you got it :)
